# Madrona Web Card Deck Object

This object is my experiment to learn Javascript. I want what I've learned in the tutorials to stick with me so I'm making something. I know there are other JS card decks out there, but I want to make mine from scratch and hopefully I'll remember the tricks and pitfalls I learn .
